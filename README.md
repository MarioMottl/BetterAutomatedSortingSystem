# BetterAutomatedSortingSystem

## Introduction
BetterAutomatedSortingSystem is a plugin that aims to simplify Minecraft auto sorting systems.
The plugin uses the item-name of the hopper (e.g. *cobble) to sort items that meet these criteria.

## Usage

```
Rename hopper in an anvil --> 

*cobble --> matches everything that ends with cobble
cobble* --> matches everything that starts with cobble
*cobble* --> matches everything that contains cobble

Names can be concatinated with "," e.g. *cobble, *oak
```
